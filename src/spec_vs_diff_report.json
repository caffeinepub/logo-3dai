  "summary": "The diff implements AI logo generation integration with OpenAI DALL-E and Google Gemini/Imagen APIs. A new service module handles API calls, the hook implements actual API requests replacing placeholder logic, and the component integrates provider selection and generated logo handling. All requirements appear to be implemented based on the diff evidence.",
